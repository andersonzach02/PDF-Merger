# PDF Merger ðŸ—ƒ

This is a repository for a small application that can merge multiple PDFs together to provide a simple, quick, and lightweight method as a more robust alternative to a simple online PDF merger.

TODO: âœ…

- [x] Fix file name labels so that each time the "Browse" button is pressed old file labels are erased
- [ ] Figure out a way to freeze the application or notify the user on the progress of the PDF merging process.
- [ ] Handle case where a file might not be chosen i.e. potentially lock the merge button until at least 2 files are chosen.
- [ ] Figure out a nice theming for the application.
- [ ] Package the application to a .exe so that it can be run as a desktop application on devices.
